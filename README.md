## Project Overview

This repository includes the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy InfoTech. In this task, I carried out data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, which was obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a renowned dataset in data science, providing detailed information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status. Widely used for educational purposes, it offers a valuable opportunity to apply and explore a range of data analysis techniques.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Titanic Dataset

- Data Cleaning:
  Missing values were handled, and duplicate records were removed to ensure data quality.

- Exploratory Analysis:
  The relationships between variables such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rate were explored.

## Results/Findings

The chart shows an age distribution ranging from 0 to over 70, with a peak around age 30. It is slightly right-skewed, with most individuals in their 20s and 30s. There are fewer people under 10 and over 60, while the smoothed blue line (KDE) highlights the central tendency near age 30.

The chart titled "Survival by Gender" shows the count of male and female survivors. It indicates that more males survived compared to females, as the bar for males is significantly higher.

The scatter plot shows the relationship between Age and Fare, with survival counts indicated by color intensity. Most fares are below 100, and individuals are mainly aged 20-50. Higher survival is observed in younger age groups, with some outliers paying higher fares.

## Conclusion
The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis conducted on the Titanic dataset revealed key factors influencing survival during the disaster. This analysis not only enhances our understanding of historical events but also showcases the practical application of data science techniques to extract meaningful insights from real-world data
